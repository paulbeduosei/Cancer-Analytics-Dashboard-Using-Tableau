# Cancer-Analytics-Dashboard-Using-Tableau

🧬 Cancer Analytics Dashboard (Tableau)

📌 Project Overview

This project was completed for a healthcare analytics client seeking to understand:
Which cancer types are most prevalent
At what stage cancers are commonly diagnosed
How treatment costs change based on cancer stage

The goal was to support early detection strategies and cost-efficient healthcare planning.

📊 Data Overview
The dataset includes:
Cancer type (Breast, Lung, Prostate, Colon, Rectum)
Diagnosis stage (0, I/II, III, IV)
Number of cases
Treatment costs over time
Geographic focus (California)

🛠️ Tools Used
Tableau Public
Data aggregation & filtering
Interactive dashboards
Visual storytelling techniques

🔍 Step-by-Step Process (What & Why)

1️⃣ Data Review & Cleaning
I reviewed the dataset for consistency across stages, cancer types, and cost values.

📌 Why: Clean data ensures accurate comparisons and trustworthy insights.

2️⃣ Cancer Prevalence Visualization
I created a stacked bar chart to show total cases by cancer type and stage.

📌 Why: This allows stakeholders to quickly identify which cancers have the highest impact.

Key Insight:

Breast and prostate cancers show the highest total case counts.

3️⃣ Diagnosis Stage Analysis
I analyzed when most diagnoses occur for each cancer type.

📌 Why: Early vs. late diagnosis strongly affects treatment cost and survival outcomes.

Key Insight:
Many cases are detected at Stage I/II, but late-stage diagnoses still represent significant risk.

4️⃣ Treatment Cost Analysis
I compared breast cancer costs across:

0–12 months post-diagnosis

12–24 months post-diagnosis

📌 Why: This shows how treatment expenses grow over time and by stage.

Key Insight:
Stage III and IV treatments are significantly more expensive than early-stage care.

5️⃣ Regional Cost Analysis (California)
I visualized total breast cancer treatment costs in California from 2004–2012.

📌 Why: Helps policymakers understand long-term healthcare spending trends.

Key Insight:

Stage I/II accounts for the largest total cost due to higher case volume.

6️⃣ Dashboard Design

I combined all charts into one interactive dashboard with clear titles and layouts.

📌 Why: Makes insights accessible to non-technical users and decision-makers.
